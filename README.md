# Mean-Variance-Standard_Deviation-Calculator-Using-Pyhton-Numpy
I created this project as a path to learning Data Analytics Using python offered by the freecodecamp.org. This project helps you to calculate Mean, Standard deviation, Variance,  of a given python array. 
The Function accepts a Python list as a parameter.
Which will then be converted into a 1D array by using np.array() method
Next we will reshape the 1D array into a 3X3 matrix
So we will need exact 9 values in the parameter list so the program will raise error if the number of elements is less than 9.
